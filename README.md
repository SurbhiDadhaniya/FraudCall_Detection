Documentation
Documentation.pdf
Detailed explanation of system workflow, training process, architecture, and application behavior.

README.md
Project introduction, structure explanation, and usage guidance.

How the System Works
Call content is provided either through text input or speech.
Speech input is converted to text using a speech recognition API.
The stored vectorizer converts text into numerical features.
The trained Logistic Regression model analyzes the features.
The app outputs whether the call is fraudulent or legitimate.

Model Details
Dataset size: ~6000 labeled call samples
Text processing: Feature vectorization with a capped feature set
Algorithm used: Logistic Regression
Model accuracy: 98.6%
The trained model and vectorizer are stored for direct use inside the application without retraining.

Technologies Used
Python – Core programming language used for ML, app development and API integration.
Scikit-learn – For model training and evaluation.
Kivy – Used for developing app's UI and for cross-platform compatibility.
Speech-to-Text API – Converts voice input into text.
Pickle – Saves trained model and vectorizer.
Buildozer – Packages the app into an APK file to make it compatible for Android.

Purpose of the Project
This project demonstrates how machine learning, NLP, and mobile app frameworks can be combined to build a practical tool for detecting scam or fraudulent calls. It highlights a real-world AI use case focused on communication security and user safety.
